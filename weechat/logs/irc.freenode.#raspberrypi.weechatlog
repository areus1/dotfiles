2015-02-10 21:38:30	ali1234	SeeThruHead: yes but raspberry pi has no ADC, so no analog sticks can be done that way
2015-02-10 21:39:16	SeeThruHead	could i convert to i2c or something
2015-02-10 21:39:20	ali1234	sure
2015-02-10 21:39:26	ali1234	all modern game controllers work that way
2015-02-10 21:39:39	ali1234	it's much easier to just use USB though
2015-02-10 21:39:43	SeeThruHead	yeahhh
2015-02-10 21:39:54	SeeThruHead	not going to be much space though

2015-02-10 21:40:03	SeeThruHead	so i was thinknig to design my own pcb
2015-02-10 21:40:13	Phosie	get a stick, 2 buttons and also the accelerometer (probably spelt wrong)
2015-02-10 21:41:19	SeeThruHead	also is it possible to cut the pi board to reduce it's size in any way, i'm trying to get this into the smallest space possible

2015-02-10 21:59:57	ali1234	seems like watchdog is active, watchdog userspace daemon is not starting correctly

2015-02-10 22:01:10	phire	the watchdog does nothing until /dev/watchdog is opened
2015-02-10 22:01:32	bandroidx	phire: any idea how to short circuit the entire thing with a single command?
2015-02-10 22:01:35	bandroidx	i only have time to run 1 command
2015-02-10 22:02:13	ali1234	phire: what if you open /dev/watchdog and subsequently the watchdog reboots the system, and then on reboot the watchdog daemon is disabled
2015-02-10 22:02:37	ali1234	does a watchdog initiated reboot... disable the watchdog?
2015-02-10 22:02:44	phire	yes
2015-02-10 22:02:55	phire	otherwise there wouldn't be enough time to finish the reboot
2015-02-10 22:03:02	ali1234	good point
2015-02-10 22:03:06	phire	I have a custom program which opens the watchdog
2015-02-10 22:03:17	ali1234	well, the module is not being loaded on reboot
2015-02-10 22:03:19	phire	it doesn't run till about 20 seconds after boot starts
2015-02-10 22:03:26	bandroidx	phire: the problem is i only have time to run a single command about 1 out of every 10 boots
2015-02-10 22:03:27	ali1234	so there should not even be a /dev/watchdog
2015-02-10 22:03:30	bandroidx	and that is if i get lucky

2015-02-10 22:03:53	ali1234	maybe the problem isn't the watchdog at all?
2015-02-10 22:03:57	bandroidx	phire: i wish, its in a remote location and extremely hard to get to
2015-02-10 22:04:05	bandroidx	ali1234: the problem started right after i enabled watchdog
2015-02-10 22:04:09	phire	oh, ssh?
2015-02-10 22:04:18	PovAddict	bandroidx: the single command could be multiple commands separated by a semicolon :)
2015-02-10 22:04:23	ali1234	bandroidx: the problem started right after you "added a ping" - what exactly does that mean?
2015-02-10 22:04:34	bandroidx	lol my current command is this
2015-02-10 22:04:34	bandroidx	sudo rm /etc/modules ; sudo fsync ; sudo echo 1 > /dev/watchdog ; sudo rm /etc/watchdog.conf ; sudo killall watchdog
2015-02-10 22:04:49	ali1234	bandroidx: don't echo 1 > /dev/watchdog
2015-02-10 22:04:52	phire	yeah, that's not really going to work
2015-02-10 22:05:17	phire	focus on disabling the watchdog daemon so it doesn't run at next boot
2015-02-10 22:05:21	bandroidx	seems fsync is also a waste of time as it says command not found
2015-02-10 22:05:27	ali1234	the command is called sync
2015-02-10 22:05:35	bandroidx	ah derp
2015-02-10 22:05:50	ali1234	watchdog daemon loads the module?
2015-02-10 22:05:51	phire	and deleting modules is pointless
2015-02-10 22:06:16	phire	udev will possibly load it anyway
2015-02-10 22:06:18	bandroidx	phire: ali1234 suggested it and it sounded like a good idea, to keep the watchdog module from running at next boot
2015-02-10 22:06:30	phire	you need to add it to the blacklist
2015-02-10 22:06:35	bandroidx	so perhaps i just need to delete /etc/watchdog.conf ?
2015-02-10 22:06:39	bandroidx	ah another good idea
2015-02-10 22:07:02	phire	no, delete the symlink which is starting the watchdog daemon
2015-02-10 22:07:28	bandroidx	but wont the module still cause it to reboot without a ping from the daemon?
2015-02-10 22:07:31	phire	something like /etc/rc*/?
2015-02-10 22:08:03	bandroidx	i was going to delete /etc/init.d/watchdog
2015-02-10 22:08:05	phire	I think the ping feature you are talking about is the watchdog daemon will try to ping an external ip address
2015-02-10 22:08:17	bandroidx	yeah and i found out after i enabled it that it doesnt work for wlan
2015-02-10 22:08:18	ali1234	the module isn;t going to get loaded if the watchdog daemon isn't running and you don't touch /dev/watchdog
2015-02-10 22:08:36	bandroidx	well my new command is this: sudo rm /etc/watchdog.conf ; sudo rm /etc/init.d/watchdog ; sudo sync ; sudo killall watchdog
2015-02-10 22:08:39	ali1234	because you deleted /etc/modules
2015-02-10 22:08:53	ali1234	phire: part of the "guide" was to put bcm2708_wdog in /etc/modules
2015-02-10 22:08:55	phire	don't bother killalling watchdog

2015-02-10 22:10:10	ali1234	next time, make the watchdog time out like 30 minutes...
2015-02-10 22:10:22	bandroidx	ali1234: trust me, i have learned my lesson
2015-02-10 22:10:39	phire	whatever you do, don't configure the watchdog remotely
2015-02-10 22:11:11	bandroidx	the device froze up yesterday and i had to go through a huge hassle to get someone to reboot it, so i had the brilliant idea of addign watchdog
2015-02-10 22:12:26	bandroidx	the main problem is i get so little time to do it
2015-02-10 22:12:30	bandroidx	usually i get only 3 pings
2015-02-10 22:12:32	bandroidx	sometimes 8
2015-02-10 22:12:44	bandroidx	one out of every 10 boots i get 8 pings and i can run 1 command if i am fast

2015-02-11 23:56:17	ali1234	Stephini: qemu for windows - qemu has two different modes of operation. one is a full system emulator, the other just emulates CPU and uses the native linux kernel for syscalls. that is a lot faster, and that is the mode used for cross compiling. cross compiling in a full qemu system emulation is slower than just compiling on the pi.
2015-02-11 23:56:51	ali1234	Stephini: virtualization on the other hand is not emulation, it is running two operating systems at the same time. so it is near native speed.
2015-02-11 23:56:59	ali1234	so in short, carry on using ubuntu in virtualbox

2015-02-12 08:28:04	Shapeshifter	Hi. I would like to control a small 12V pump using the raspberry pi. So far I've found out that I will need a mosfet, a gate resistor, a flyback diode and I will need to connect the ground of the rpi to the ground of the pump power supply. My question is wether this last bit is okay to do. basically, I would need to connect the GND pin of the rpi to the neutral cable of the 12V PSU. Sounds scary.
2015-02-12 08:28:59	Matt	no, you don't want to do that :)
2015-02-12 08:29:19	Matt	you don't want to hook things up to the mains/line side of a PSU under normal operation
2015-02-12 08:29:43	Matt	you actually need to tie the gnd of the pi to gnd of the pump's PSU output
2015-02-12 08:30:04	Stephini	kushal if you already have an xbox controller and adapter for use on the PC there are excelent drivers for that.

2015-02-12 08:30:42	pksato	Shapeshifter: safe way (for beginers) is to use a relay. isolates pi and device on control.
2015-02-12 08:30:54	Matt	pksato: I was about to suggest that :)
2015-02-12 08:30:59	Stephini	a wired controller would work without an adapter. the wireless needs the adapter
2015-02-12 08:31:01	Encrypt	Shapeshifter, Use an optocoupler ;)
2015-02-12 08:31:18	Stephini	both work with both drivers but only xboxdrv supports the lights properly. with the out of the box one the lights will just blink.
2015-02-12 08:31:25	pksato	have lots os relay modules for arduindo that work on RPi, after some adjusts (hw or software)
2015-02-12 08:31:34	Shapeshifter	Matt: Yes, not the mains/line side of the PSU, I meant the V0 part of the 12V supply line coming from the power adaptor.
2015-02-12 08:31:41	Encrypt	Shapeshifter, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opto-isolator
2015-02-12 08:32:00	pksato	or a DC SSR.
2015-02-12 08:32:03	Matt	also avoids any potential issues with ground loops and the like
2015-02-12 08:32:20	Matt	SSR == Solid State Relay
2015-02-12 08:32:36	Encrypt	Bistable relay :]
2015-02-12 08:32:38	Stephini	the driver that comes with retropie works tho kushal even if the blinking lights are ugly as sin. switching to xboxdrv is also very easy and i could walk you through that.
2015-02-12 08:32:42	Matt	and for switching a big inductive load like a pump, I'd be tempted to go that route
2015-02-12 08:32:51	Encrypt	Good idea indeed
2015-02-12 08:33:07	Shapeshifter	I see, so I go with an SSR and then I don't need the flyback diode anymore.
2015-02-12 08:33:13	Matt	correct
2015-02-12 08:33:22	Shapeshifter	thanks
2015-02-12 08:33:49	kushal	Stephini, Thanks, I will try to get one controller as soon as possible
2015-02-12 08:33:54	Matt	it also means you don't need to ensure the pump and the pi are the same power segment
2015-02-12 08:34:30	kushal	Stephini, something like http://www.flipkart.com/microsoft-wired-controller-windows/p/itmdkzhyfgpm349g?pid=ACCDYH2ZFYHY5H9N&otracker=from-search&srno=t_1&query=xbox+controller+&ref=33813e7f-9ef0-4e0e-babe-0dee8fb51242 will do?
2015-02-12 08:35:14	pksato	Shapeshifter: but, yes, need to connect GND (or commom) to some line on 12V power line. to +12V or 0V. depending that is commom reference.
2015-02-12 08:35:33	Stephini	yeah that would work. i have no idea of 25 hundred Rs is a good deal. :P my currency of choice is USD and i personally wouldn't go above 20 for a wired. especially not since it's a generation old.
2015-02-12 08:36:03	Shapeshifter	pksato: Do I still need to do this if I use a relay?
2015-02-12 08:36:32	Matt	Shapeshifter: no, if you use a relay, you don't need to common reference
2015-02-12 08:36:57	pksato	ah... yes and no.
2015-02-12 08:36:58	Matt	a relay is basically an electricly/electronicaly controlled switch
2015-02-12 08:37:39	pksato	yes: need to connect coil of relay to RPi, but, rpi not have power to drive.
2015-02-12 08:38:12	Matt	traditional relays are just an electromagnet that controls a spring-loaded switch
2015-02-12 08:38:20	Matt	energise the coil, and the switch closes
2015-02-12 08:38:33	Matt	de-energise it, and the switch opens again
2015-02-12 08:38:42	pksato	have a lot of blog about this subject.
2015-02-12 08:39:04	kushal	Stephini, $20 is around Rs. 1200
2015-02-12 08:39:09	Matt	but as pksato says, the gpio pins on the pi don't have enough grunt to drive a relay coil
2015-02-12 08:39:49	Matt	but if you're using a decent 5V supply for the pi, it probably does
2015-02-12 08:40:18	Matt	so you have the gpio pin feed a transistor, which drives the relay
2015-02-12 08:40:36	Stephini	ahh then according to my local market and my personal value judgements it's a ripoff. but your local market and your determination could easily be different.

2015-02-12 08:46:09	Stephini	of course going 3rd party runs the risk that the drivers may not be compatible. though from what i read the drivers have strong third party support.

2015-02-12 08:52:37	Shapeshifter	So, am I understanding this correctly that an opto-coupler would not work for me (controlling a 12V water pump) because the load current of the "output" side of the opto coupler doesn't support as much current (seens something like 20-100 mA).
2015-02-12 08:52:42	Stephini	oh kushal in case your interested retropie has it's own irc over at #retropie where you can ask any retropie specific questions you may have.

2015-02-12 08:53:04	Shapeshifter	The pump probably draws more power, hence I need a relay?
2015-02-12 08:53:12	SpeedEvil	Shapeshifter: yes
2015-02-12 08:53:21	SpeedEvil	Shapeshifter: or some amplifier after the optoisolator
2015-02-12 08:53:30	clever	you could also use a power mosfet after the optoisolator
2015-02-12 08:53:55	clever	the mosfet would be operating on the motor gnd, isolated from the pi gnd by the optoisolator
2015-02-12 08:54:24	Shapeshifter	clever: couldn't the optoisolator output side still be fried by a spike in this case?
2015-02-12 08:54:42	clever	possibly, so i would keep the flyback diode
2015-02-12 08:55:00	clever	and anyways, the opto is much cheaper then a pi, so you can easily replace it
2015-02-12 08:55:13	Shapeshifter	yep

2015-02-12 09:38:39	Stephini	ok with a light i can see my controller is missing pin 8. so that's another one we wouldn't need.
2015-02-12 09:38:45	clever	Stephini: so you only need 4 GPIO to talk to it i believe

2015-02-12 09:39:44	clever	yeah
2015-02-12 09:39:47	clever	you have to clock out each bit
2015-02-12 09:39:54	clever	but i suspect you could use the SPI port
2015-02-12 09:40:34	Payo	anyone tried the debian jessie image yet ?
2015-02-12 09:41:14	Stephini	so if i want to later expand to PS2 i should probably stick to nonspecial GPIO so long as i'm not hurting for pins.

2015-02-12 09:41:51	clever	from a quick glance at this page, i think you could use the SPI interface, but you would need some testing to confirm that
2015-02-12 09:42:23	Stephini	worst case scenario nes takes 5 per controller. so 10 and db9 takes if i recall only 5 or 6. so 22 worst case scenario.

2015-02-12 13:30:10	imbezol	i'm thinking it would be fun to take a 4U server case.. hollow it out except for a power supply.. bolt in a gigabit switch, and a couple dozen pis

2015-02-12 17:50:53	Klaus_Dieter	yeah. that is my point. My guess is that the arduino + cc1101 + wifi-dongle use more than 500mA overloading the usb of the raspi
2015-02-12 17:51:11	ali1234	the raspi USB can supply more than 500mA

2015-02-12 17:52:30	ali1234	maybe that's the trouble then

2015-02-12 17:53:10	Klaus_Dieter	will I break the boards when connecting the 5v pin of the arduino to the 5v gpio of the raspi?
2015-02-12 17:53:27	ali1234	no
2015-02-12 17:54:09	ali1234	you might confuse the USB chip though
2015-02-12 17:54:16	Klaus_Dieter	ok. I will try that. I also thought about getting rid of the usb-connection between pi and arduino and using a serial console directly
2015-02-12 17:54:38	Klaus_Dieter	but I have not done my research yet on whether this is even possible
2015-02-12 17:54:40	ali1234	get rid of the arduino and connect the module directly to the pi gpio?
2015-02-12 17:54:57	clever	you can also connect the arduino to the ttl uart on the gpio header
2015-02-12 17:55:00	clever	and bypass the usb layer
2015-02-12 17:55:09	ali1234	that wnt save any power though
2015-02-12 17:55:14	Klaus_Dieter	ali1234: thought about that too. but the module does not have a macro controller- that means I would have to port the firmware on the arduino to the raspberry pi
2015-02-12 17:55:22	clever	ali1234: but it will bypass the poly fuses on the usb port

2015-02-13 06:15:18	lost_and_unfound	greetings, I have ownloaded and booted with the latest version of NOOBS. However the network I am connected on requires static IP and does not support DHCP. So it is unable to continue the install. I have assigned a manual IP in command line via ifconfig and added DNS and routes, but the Install and Edit config options stay greyed out. Any suggestion to resolve this?

2015-02-13 17:52:47	cyanide	yeah sure
2015-02-13 17:53:28	cyanide	just need to know where the partitions are in /dev/sdX or /dev/sdXY

2015-02-13 17:55:25	cyanide	i want to be sure before i buy an lcd
2015-02-13 17:55:43	cyanide	so many available here with various controllers: http://www.buydisplay.com/default/tft-display
2015-02-13 17:56:09	thescatman	thanks cyanide... i'll try and work out how that works then
2015-02-13 17:56:09	clever	ive been considering an hdmi one from adafruit lately
2015-02-13 17:56:14	cyanide	with my micros, i just grab one which has spi and there usually is someone who has made a library for it, else i just make mine
2015-02-13 17:56:24	clever	cyanide: http://www.adafruit.com/products/2232 is what i was thinking of
2015-02-13 17:56:34	cyanide	these are mostly barebones, except the ones with the big driver board

2015-02-13 17:57:59	cyanide	you're basically buying from the manufacturer directly
2015-02-13 17:58:00	clever	cheaper, but you dont need vga or composite
2015-02-13 17:58:05	cyanide	or atleast as direct as you can get
2015-02-13 17:58:30	clever	the adafruit one is a board they made, and it will also have a touch version soon i think

2015-02-13 17:59:48	clever	ah
2015-02-13 18:00:10	cyanide	for changing the display settings, plus if you want to use it separately for your own stuff

2015-02-13 18:00:28	thescatman	is there a way to increase the amps to a usb port? I'm not able to run a hard drive off one of them it seems :/
2015-02-13 18:00:52	clever	cyanide: ah
2015-02-13 18:01:05	clever	kind of need that when you have so many inputs to select between
2015-02-13 18:01:14	clever	and vga/composite need more fine tuning
2015-02-13 18:01:17	cyanide	yeah

2015-02-13 18:02:49	thescatman	PovAddict: good idea
2015-02-13 18:03:49	thescatman	Any idea of the maximum performance gain of a micro sd in transfer speeds for the pi? like, is there a limit? I've got a high end sandisk extreme pro in it atm but that was for a hummingboard
2015-02-13 18:04:17	thescatman	The ultra or lower end class 10 cards would save me some cash
2015-02-13 18:04:38	cyanide	the theoretical limit is the spi bus
2015-02-13 18:05:06	plugwash	The raspberry pi's SD slot is not SPI
2015-02-13 18:05:09	thescatman	i think I read about that, that's the thing that bottlenecks the ethernet and usb speeds right
2015-02-13 18:05:54	shiftplusone	the common wisdom is that sequential read/write speeds are irrelevant when it comes to the way sd cards are actually used in devices like the pi, so a class 10 card is mostly a waste of money.
2015-02-13 18:06:39	plugwash	AIUI sequential transfer speeds on the Pi are limited by the fact the SD card interface is fixed to 3.3V
2015-02-13 18:06:45	clever	i suspect a log based filesystem would take full advantage of sequential writes, but i dont know if anybody has tried one on a pi yet
2015-02-13 18:06:48	plugwash	and the higher speed SD modes require lower voltages
2015-02-13 18:06:50	cyanide	plugwash, my bad
