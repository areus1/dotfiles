2015-02-25 22:23:09	robertmaxrees	if the code was written correctly, the .done() on the $.when() should only fire when all of the deferred objects are resolved.

2015-02-25 22:41:44	shoky	SeeThruHead: right. because you're using .done instead of .then  and .done returns the ORIGINAL promise
2015-02-25 22:42:15	SeeThruHead	i think that is starting to make sense, why is the original promise not resolved
2015-02-25 22:42:16	shoky	so it will not wait for x,y,z   (though if they are synchronous i'd imagine it might work still)
2015-02-25 22:43:06	shoky	but you should stop trying to set the global objects from the callbacks, and instead use the promises themselves as the values. (or, as ways to get at the values)

2015-02-25 23:16:49	robertmaxrees	so get that part working.  then you'll need to replace to modal contents with an embedded PDF.

2015-02-26 00:42:35	jakesy	you dont seem to have a URL identified
2015-02-26 00:43:03	Guddu	I am trying to show a pdf in a modal object. To get the pdf data I am doing a ajax post. The ajax post goes fine but how do i render the pdf inside the modal? Please help.
2015-02-26 00:44:00	Guddu	I get Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token % in Javascript console
2015-02-26 00:44:01	jakesy	Guddu: are you using <object data="/url/to/myDoc.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="100%"> ?
2015-02-26 00:44:32	Guddu	jakesy, No. I don't get a URL to the PDF object. I get the PDF itself as ajax response
2015-02-26 00:44:41	Guddu	The data shows up something like %PDF-1.5 in the first line
2015-02-26 00:45:22	Dr-007	how do you find out what function is part of which  jquery plugin? im trying to find out what $('.something').collapse() is part of

2015-02-26 00:46:51	Guddu	jakesy, I am doomed
2015-02-26 00:47:36	jakesy	It doesn't look like it. Why are your PDF's coming back as ajax calls? are you constructing them on request or something?
2015-02-26 00:47:58	jqueryius	jakesy - I have a URL
2015-02-26 00:48:06	jqueryius	it's just that symfony uses path() to inject it
2015-02-26 00:48:20	jqueryius	in fact, it's hitting the breakpoint on that URL

2015-02-26 00:50:01	jqueryius	oh hang on
2015-02-26 00:50:08	jqueryius	no, the task.getId() is GET data
2015-02-26 00:50:16	jqueryius	thats working ok
2015-02-26 00:50:22	jqueryius	it's the emailAddresses that is post data
2015-02-26 00:50:59	Guddu	jakesy, Basically the server is reading a PDF file from disk and sending it back.
2015-02-26 00:52:08	Guddu	jakesy, In the response header i have "Content-Type: application/pdf"
2015-02-26 00:52:17	__alangi__	hello

2015-02-26 00:52:26	__alangi__	?
2015-02-26 00:52:27	jakesy	Guddu: I suggest using the ajax call to return the URL of the pdf, and then when you have that, to use an <object data="pdf" ...> tag to render it in a modal
2015-02-26 00:52:34	Guddu	Can i use that response type to update the modal html?
2015-02-26 00:52:44	jakesy	__alangi__, sorry but I can see you're already trolling in ##javascript
2015-02-26 00:52:56	jqueryius	__alangi__ what is the website. it looks like a referral / spam link judging from the url
2015-02-26 00:52:56	Guddu	jakesy, PDF is lying on the disk. Its not available through apache web server
2015-02-26 00:53:17	__alangi__	jqueryius: thats what i want to hear
2015-02-26 00:53:33	jqueryius	why

2015-02-26 00:53:44	__alangi__	jqueryius: because i thought of that too
2015-02-26 00:53:54	jqueryius	how much money do you make per click

2015-02-26 00:55:20	jakesy	Guddu: I'm not sure. All the stackoverflow results say you should host the pdf files on the webserver and serve them as static content

2015-02-26 04:52:31	DRSK	Cork » well I'm using a library to "lock" elements so scrolling vertically actually moves horizontally for a set period of pixels; however if I simply run jQuery( '.elem' ).offset().top that returns false coords; it falls short most of the time. Although maybe it gets the offset in regards of the closest parent element it can find? Might have to try some more then, hmph.

2015-02-26 07:47:42	aways_	Simple question I thinks
2015-02-26 07:47:57	aways_	How it's possible to reencapsulate the addEvent function off Jquery

2015-02-26 11:05:12	sacho	Cryp71c, on* attributes always use the global scope to execute their given javascript.
2015-02-26 11:05:16	cjohnson	basichash: that code shouldn't stop you from typing unless your handler is wrong
2015-02-26 11:05:26	xec	Cryp71c: a couple of reasons. first being scope. if you want to call a function from the attribute you need it to be global - and the global scope gets littered quick - does not scale.
2015-02-26 11:05:29	microhaxo	I thought this might work: $(window).scrollTop($(window).scrollTop() * self.scale);  and it only works for the first scale increment of .10

I do much of what cjohnson just said, in addition to the data-binding in view templates, makes it easier to go back later.

2015-02-26 13:24:22	frabblerock	but why? because this refers to the click and the el refered to a stored url?
2015-02-26 13:24:39	robertmaxrees	the $(this) is the jquery-fied element the event emitted from.
2015-02-26 13:24:51	stylica	hm, it doesn't look like jquery will be replaced by vanilla js soon
2015-02-26 13:24:54	robertmaxrees	your els.next was the element that was cached on pageload.
2015-02-26 13:25:09	frabblerock	yeah
2015-02-26 13:25:11	frabblerock	that makes sense.
2015-02-26 13:25:31	frabblerock	is there anyway to combine this into one function so im not repeating the same code
2015-02-26 13:25:38	frabblerock	and just update the elements?
2015-02-26 13:26:03	cjohnson	stylica: jquery is just a library. one won't "replace" the other. you just choose to use the jquery library on some projects and not on others
2015-02-26 13:26:17	frabblerock	i tried but the way the url is being stored made it difficult
2015-02-26 13:26:36	cjohnson	the native DOM is getting better but it's still very verbose and there's a lot of boilerplate. but a lot of people also use jquery when a single helper function to reduce boilerplate would work well

2015-02-26 16:55:20	robertmaxrees	the why is pretty simple.
2015-02-26 16:55:24	jeffmjack	it's just getting an http request, right?
2015-02-26 16:55:26	jeffmjack	of course that
2015-02-26 16:55:33	robertmaxrees	let me explain :)
2015-02-26 16:55:34	jeffmjack	's going to come from some random user
2015-02-26 16:55:37	jeffmjack	ok :)
2015-02-26 16:55:50	robertmaxrees	let's assume for a moment that you're like most other users and leave yourself logged into gmail.

2015-02-26 19:57:53	frabblerock	?
2015-02-26 19:58:06	robertmaxrees	this is why premature optimization is bad.
2015-02-26 19:58:20	robertmaxrees	if you really want to make this super efficient, make an api that exposes JSON for the events and use some client-side templating to build out what you need.
2015-02-26 19:58:32	frabblerock	i was using handlebars at first
2015-02-26 19:58:47	frabblerock	but was then forced to use php for initial page laod
2015-02-26 19:58:47	robertmaxrees	otherwise, stop worrying about this particular problem.
2015-02-26 19:58:51	frabblerock	and changing dates
2015-02-26 19:59:05	frabblerock	hence why im using ajax
2015-02-26 19:59:17	doug16k	frabblerock, if you end up using my code, you can maximize 1st display performance by starting the loads in <head> asap after loading jquery
2015-02-26 19:59:40	doug16k	that causes you to have to load jquery in head though so ymmv, try it and see

2015-02-26 20:01:00	robertmaxrees	bl4ckdu5t you need to use a string, not a jquery object, for that second arg.

2015-02-26 20:02:43	doug16k	frabblerock, in a modern browser it would use a keep-alive connection and should stream the requests, so the cost is lower than it looks
2015-02-26 20:03:00	bl4ckdu5t	no I'm trying to giv ve it a fixed class

2015-02-26 20:03:10	robertmaxrees	bl4ckdu5t when what happens?
2015-02-26 20:03:11	doug16k	the php side will probably be doing expensive things though
2015-02-26 20:03:14	bl4ckdu5t	when the class is fixed, the search input sticks to top of page
2015-02-26 20:03:25	doug16k	frabblerock, referring to your question about how bad is 4 separate requests

2015-02-27 06:41:11	Tennis	or otherwise shed some light?
2015-02-27 06:42:03	Cork	Tennis: function()loadXMLDoc() isn't valid js5
2015-02-27 06:42:16	Cork	that is a javascript 1.8 extension

2015-02-27 06:42:53	Cork	js5 writes that as function() { loadXMLDoc() }
2015-02-27 06:43:10	Tennis	ahh thanks let me give that try
2015-02-27 06:43:15	Cork	but as you don't pass any arguments you can shorten that to setInterval, loadXMLDoc, 3000)
2015-02-27 06:43:23	Cork	opps
2015-02-27 06:43:28	Cork	setInterval(loadXMLDoc, 3000)
2015-02-27 06:43:45	Cork	Tennis: also be careful with setInterval
2015-02-27 06:43:56	Cork	you most likely want to use setTimeout instead
2015-02-27 06:44:12	Tennis	Cork Beuler you're my hero
2015-02-27 06:44:26	Tennis	Yeah I red setTimeout is better on stackoverflow
2015-02-27 06:44:43	Cork	setInterval has a scary effect that it doesn't account for the time it takes for the code to run
2015-02-27 06:44:58	Cork	so if the computer gets busy, or goes to sleep or something like that
2015-02-27 06:45:14	Cork	you can/will end up with it running constantly with calls back to back when it starts again
2015-02-27 06:45:26	Cork	(cause the execution of the function has been queued up)
2015-02-27 06:45:30	Tennis	does Timeout have the desired reuslt
2015-02-27 06:45:48	Cork	you have to queue it again after each time the function executes
2015-02-27 06:46:03	Cork	so you delay the next execution by the time it took the first loop to execute
2015-02-27 06:46:18	Cork	and there by never a risk if "queuing up"

2015-02-27 06:54:54	Fod	However, i want to toggle the div and form element
2015-02-27 06:55:20	Fod	would i try and find by ID, if that ID doesnt exist, then append a new field?
2015-02-27 06:55:45	Fod	else, if the ID does exist, then hide() that field?

2015-02-28 14:56:31	Jabby__	Hey guys, I'm new to ajax calls and javascript really and abit confused, if someone could help me that would be great :) So I'm wanting to create an ajax progress bar, my php script is going to echo the percentage complete. So i'm looking at this example here http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/ . Is this relevant to my needs?

2015-02-28 16:45:32	GingerGeek_	They are all just queued at the moment waiting for previous ones to finish

2015-02-28 16:57:01	rcyr	A bit far from 1000
2015-02-28 16:57:05	SgtPooki	quite a bit
2015-02-28 16:57:09	Omar-	GingerGeek_ then make them  synchronous
2015-02-28 16:57:16	SgtPooki	the http spec actually says 2 connection limit
2015-02-28 16:57:18	GingerGeek_	They are fine async
2015-02-28 16:57:25	SgtPooki	but browsers are at anywhere between 2-10 now
2015-02-28 16:57:39	Omar-	async (default: true)
2015-02-28 16:57:39	Omar-	By default, all requests are sent asynchronously (i.e. this is set to true by default). If you need synchronous requests, set this option to false. Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation. Note that synchronous requests may temporarily lock the browser, disabling any actions while the request is active.
2015-02-28 16:57:50	GingerGeek_	It takes about 10 mins to get through all the requests lol
2015-02-28 16:57:56	rcyr	You never want to lock the browser.
2015-02-28 16:57:58	GingerGeek_	Omar-, I don't want sync
2015-02-28 16:58:03	SgtPooki	still, 10 is far from 1000, but if your network requests are small, parallel requests using es6 Promise.all or similar will improve total wait time
2015-02-28 16:58:16	GingerGeek_	rcyr, it's only locked for network requests
2015-02-28 16:58:26	rcyr	GingerGeek_: And?
2015-02-28 16:58:38	GingerGeek_	Welll is there a way to prioritise a request?
2015-02-28 16:58:43	SgtPooki	nope
2015-02-28 16:58:53	SgtPooki	call that ajax call first..
2015-02-28 16:59:03	GingerGeek_	It's an import function that will get used once a year
2015-02-28 16:59:18	GingerGeek_	If it stops the browser tab laoding anythig for a few mins
2015-02-28 16:59:22	GingerGeek_	I think it's OK

2015-02-28 17:11:58	GingerGeek	Is there somethign wrong with my implementation?
2015-02-28 17:12:03	SgtPooki	because. you're processing data in serial right now
2015-02-28 17:12:08	SgtPooki	you want it to go faster, right?
2015-02-28 17:12:27	GingerGeek	It's not a big priority but I would like it to yeah
2015-02-28 17:12:35	SgtPooki	if you want it to go faster, the only way without thoroughly analyzing your code is to parallelize your code.
2015-02-28 17:13:03	SgtPooki	to make multiple ajax calls at a time instead of chaining each one behind the previous
2015-02-28 17:13:11	GingerGeek	ohhh
2015-02-28 17:13:16	SgtPooki	but your ajax call itself looks fine as it is
2015-02-28 17:13:21	GingerGeek	But I don't think they are chained one behind the other
2015-02-28 17:13:33	GingerGeek	I think it's just the browser limit

2015-02-28 17:16:38	SgtPooki	thats a huge bottleneck
2015-02-28 17:16:41	SgtPooki	you should cache that value

2015-02-28 17:17:00	GingerGeek	there's a reason my IDE yells at me for duplicate jquery selectors?

2015-02-28 17:19:05	SgtPooki	var $p = jQuery('<p />'); then in your before, error, and success callbacks, do something like $logEl.append($p.clone().text('whatevr text'));
2015-02-28 17:19:43	GingerGeek	 $p = jQuery('<p />'); why do I need to cache that??
2015-02-28 17:19:45	SgtPooki	if you cache both of those elements outside of that ajax call, so that each one is no longer querying the database, or building dom elements from strings (very expensive..)
2015-02-28 17:19:52	SgtPooki	then you will probably cut your time in half
2015-02-28 17:20:01	GingerGeek	Why not jsut logvarrthingy.append("<p>sddfafd</P>");
2015-02-28 17:20:04	SgtPooki	because building dom elements from strings with jquery is expensive
2015-02-28 17:20:10	GingerGeek	kk
2015-02-28 17:20:15	SgtPooki	let me get an article..
2015-02-28 17:20:48	SgtPooki	http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/manipulating-elements/
2015-02-28 17:21:09	SgtPooki	The syntax for adding new elements to the page is easy, so it's tempting to forget that there's a huge performance cost for adding to the DOM repeatedly. If you're adding many elements to the same container, you'll want to concatenate all the HTML into a single string, and then append that string to the container instead of appending the elements one at a time. Use an array to gather all the pieces together, then join them into a 
2015-02-28 17:21:43	SgtPooki	jquery even has a sample there.. they actually suggest building all the strings together and then appending that whole large string at the end.. but I don't think that would keep the same functionality you currently have
2015-02-28 17:22:18	SgtPooki	ok, time to play in the snow with the little devil
2015-02-28 17:22:24	GingerGeek	What's the difference between var pthing = and $pthing = and var $pthing =
2015-02-28 17:22:30	GingerGeek	oh kk
2015-02-28 17:22:31	GingerGeek	cya
2015-02-28 17:22:40	SgtPooki	you always define new variables with var
2015-02-28 17:22:47	SgtPooki	*should..
2015-02-28 17:22:53	GingerGeek	oh good
2015-02-28 17:22:54	GingerGeek	I do
2015-02-28 17:23:06	SgtPooki	but var pthing = test; and var $pthing = test; are the same
2015-02-28 17:23:16	SgtPooki	its convention to prepend var names with $ that are jquery objects
2015-02-28 17:23:25	SgtPooki	or whatever other library.. (angular prepends many providers with $)
