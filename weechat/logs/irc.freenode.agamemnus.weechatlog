2015-02-07 01:27:14	Agamemnus	page_doscroll (zoom_factor, x, y)
2015-02-07 01:27:22	Agamemnus	  var offsetx = (page_style.offsetx - x) * (scale / page_style.scale) + x
2015-02-07 01:27:22	Agamemnus	  var offsety = (page_style.offsety - y) * (scale / page_style.scale) + y
2015-02-07 01:27:58	SeeThruHead	sorry i'm bad at following this kind of thing
2015-02-07 01:28:45	Agamemnus	ok forget about that, just re-read your question
2015-02-07 01:29:00	Agamemnus	first thing I would do is to take a piece of paper
2015-02-07 01:29:05	Agamemnus	start drawing your situation
2015-02-07 01:29:07	Agamemnus	use labels
2015-02-07 01:29:12	SeeThruHead	the idea is
2015-02-07 01:29:16	Agamemnus	you will see the solution
2015-02-07 01:29:27	SeeThruHead	i can't see the solution without using 3d transforms
2015-02-07 01:29:30	SeeThruHead	or some other hacks
2015-02-07 01:29:42	Agamemnus	<SeeThruHead> say you have a grid of windows, that each need to "look through" to an image, the image is 2x the size of the viewing hole, how would you translate them all from viewing the bottom of the image to the top, based on where they are in the browser window
2015-02-07 01:29:44	SeeThruHead	not without modifying the position of each element
2015-02-07 01:29:48	Agamemnus	this sounds 2d to me
2015-02-07 01:30:23	SeeThruHead	lets say you have a vertical list of images
2015-02-07 01:30:58	SeeThruHead	let's say 3 images on top of eachother
2015-02-07 01:31:12	SeeThruHead	and you have 3 windows on screen stacked in a similar manner
2015-02-07 01:31:40	SeeThruHead	you want the bottom window to show the bottom half of the bottom image on the image layer, middle to show the middle of the middle and top the top
2015-02-07 01:31:45	SeeThruHead	like perspective
2015-02-07 01:32:00	SeeThruHead	is there a way you could do it by just moving the whole image layer by itself
2015-02-07 01:32:10	Agamemnus	i see
2015-02-07 01:32:12	SeeThruHead	or do youahve to move each image relative to it's container
2015-02-07 01:32:22	Agamemnus	hold on let me thing about what you are saying
2015-02-07 01:32:35	SeeThruHead	its like 3 windows with different landscapes
2015-02-07 01:32:46	SeeThruHead	but you want to show perspective as the user scrolls
2015-02-07 01:34:05	Agamemnus	i'm still trying to figure out what youse saying
2015-02-07 01:34:31	Agamemnus	ok I see
2015-02-07 01:34:54	Agamemnus	it's about distance, you have to imagine a rectangle away from you
2015-02-07 01:35:20	Agamemnus	honestly the best way to do it is
2015-02-07 01:35:27	Agamemnus	ask someone who did it already
2015-02-07 01:35:37	Agamemnus	his name escapes me, but he also has many sses

2015-02-07 01:38:14	Agamemnus	Does that help?
2015-02-07 01:38:29	SeeThruHead	hasn' loaded
2015-02-07 01:38:41	Agamemnus	you need to use chrome
2015-02-07 01:38:45	Agamemnus	and move your phone
2015-02-07 01:38:56	Agamemnus	physically move it
2015-02-07 01:39:05	SeeThruHead	yeah not really
2015-02-07 01:39:08	SeeThruHead	thanks anyway
2015-02-07 01:39:16	Agamemnus	it uses 3d css
2015-02-07 01:39:24	Agamemnus	don't you see the feet?
2015-02-07 01:39:30	SeeThruHead	yeah but
